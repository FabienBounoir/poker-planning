# Security Report & Recommendations

## Security Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. CORS Misconfiguration (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Issue**: The application was configured with `cors: { origin: "*" }` allowing any website to make requests to the server.

**Risk**: Cross-origin attacks, unauthorized access to socket.io endpoints.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Configured proper origin whitelist for both Express and Socket.IO
- Added environment variable `FRONTEND_URL` for configuration
- Restricted to specific allowed domains

### 2. Input Validation Vulnerabilities (HIGH - FIXED)
**Issues**:
- No input sanitization for user names, room IDs, or user stories
- No length limits on user inputs
- Insufficient avatar URL validation

**Risk**: XSS attacks, injection attacks, data corruption.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `sanitizeInput()` function to clean user inputs
- Implemented proper URL validation for avatars
- Added room ID format validation
- Sanitized all user-provided data

### 3. File Upload Security Issues (HIGH - FIXED)
**Issues**:
- No file size validation
- No content type validation
- Hardcoded external service dependency
- No rate limiting

**Risk**: DoS attacks, unauthorized file uploads, data exposure.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added 5MB file size limit
- Implemented content type validation
- Made external service URL configurable
- Added proper error handling

### 4. Rate Limiting (MEDIUM - FIXED)
**Issue**: No rate limiting on socket connections.

**Risk**: DoS attacks, resource exhaustion.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Implemented connection rate limiting (10 connections per IP per minute)
- Added cleanup mechanism for expired connections

### 5. Security Headers (MEDIUM - FIXED)
**Issue**: Missing security headers.

**Risk**: Various client-side attacks.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive security headers middleware
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Added XSS protection, frame options, content type options

### 6. Dependency Vulnerabilities (HIGH - PARTIALLY FIXED)
**Issues**: Multiple high and moderate severity vulnerabilities in npm packages.

**Status**: Backend vulnerabilities fixed, frontend still has some remaining issues.

**Action Required**: Update frontend dependencies when compatible versions are available.

## Current Security Status

### ✅ Resolved Issues
- CORS configuration secured
- Input validation implemented
- File upload security enhanced
- Rate limiting added
- Security headers implemented
- Backend dependency vulnerabilities fixed

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues
- Some frontend dependency vulnerabilities (awaiting compatible updates)
- TypeScript errors in existing code (not security-related)

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
2. **Access Control**: CORS properly configured with origin whitelist
3. **Rate Limiting**: Connection rate limiting prevents abuse
4. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
5. **File Upload Security**: Size limits and content type validation
6. **Environment Configuration**: Sensitive URLs made configurable

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Monitor Dependencies**: Regularly run `npm audit` and update when fixes are available
2. **Security Testing**: Implement regular security scanning
3. **Authentication**: Consider adding authentication for room managers
4. **Logging**: Add security event logging for monitoring
5. **HTTPS**: Ensure HTTPS is used in production

## Environment Variables

Update your `.env` files with the new security configuration:

```bash
# Frontend
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:5876"
VITE_CUSTOM_AVATAR_ENABLED="true"
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
UPLOAD_URL="https://s.draftbot.fr/upload"
UPLOAD_ORIGIN="https://www.draftbot.fr"

# Backend
PORT=5876
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
NODE_ENV="development"
```
